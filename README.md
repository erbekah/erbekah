- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @erbekah, or better known in real life as Beka!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in constantly learning and upskilling. I'm a product designer by trade, currently working as a UX designer. I love, and am passionate about design and using good design and research to improve and better the lives of others. I'm interested in technology and learning more about how technology can aid in the every day life.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the very basics. Starting with web development on my first project of building a website for a portfolio. I would also like to learn more about the uses of AI and ML
