- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @erbekah, or better known in real life as Beka!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in constantly learning and upskilling. I'm a product designer by trade, currently working as a UX designer. I love, and am passionate about design and using good design and research to improve and better the lives of others. I'm interested in technology and learning more about how technology can aid in the every day life.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Flutter as it feels like a good place to start! I come from a background of very minimal dev and programming experience but I have always been interested to learn and I feel now is a great time!
